            <div class="nine doctor">
                <img class="doc" src="./images/eccleston.jpg" alt="The Ninth Doctor, Christopher Eccleston."/>
                    <p>A northern accent. Big smile, and an offbeat sense of humour… <strong>The Ninth Doctor</strong> was the bruised but brilliant ‘last of the Time Lords’.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ten doctor">
                <img class="doc" src="./images/tennant.jpg" alt="The Tenth Doctor, David Tennant."/>
                    <p><strong>The Tenth Doctor</strong> was a charismatic mixture of apparent opposites… Kind and sensitive, only countered by his inflated ego at times. </p>
            </div>

            <div class="eleven doctor">
                <img class="doc" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p00s7x9l.jpg" alt="The Eleventh Doctor, Matt Smith."/>
                    <p><strong>The Eleventh Doctor</strong> was an excited explorer of the universe, with a keen intelligence that means he often notices what everyone else has missed.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="twelve doctor">
                <img class="doc" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p04znlgh.jpg" alt="The Twelfth Doctor, Peter Capaldi."/>
                    <p>Initially stern and ruthless, but in reality kind and forgiving, <strong>the Twelfth Doctor</strong> was the first incarnation after the end of The Siege of Trenzalore.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="thirteen doctor">
                <img class="doc" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p06n8s8t.jpg" alt="The Thirteenth Doctor, Jodie Whittaker."/>
                    <p><strong>The Thirteenth Doctor</strong> was a charismatic and confident explorer, championing fairness and kindness wherever she can.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="fourteen doctor">
                <img class="doc" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/2/29/Fourteenth_Doctor_%28Doctor_Who%29.jpg" alt="The Edge Doctor, David Tennant... again."/>
                    <p>After The Master's attempt to steal The Doctor's body, the need to regenerate came... and <strong>The Edge Doctor</strong> was born.</p>
            </div>

                <img class="doc" src="./images/15.jpg" alt="The Fifteenth Doctor, Ncuti Gatwa."/>
                    <p><strong>The Fifteenth Doctor</strong> is a future regeneration; his personality and motives are still yet unknown...</p>

                <em>I do what I do, because it's right! Because it's decent! And above all, it's kind. It's just that. Just kind. If I run away today, good people will die. If I stand and fight, some of them might live. Maybe not many, maybe not for long. Hey, you know, maybe there's no point in any of this at all, but it's the best I can do, so I'm going to do it. And I will stand here doing it 'till it kills me. You're going to die too, some day. How will that be? Have you thought about it? What would you die for? Who I am is where I stand. Where I stand... is where I fall.</em>
