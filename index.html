                <img class="doc" src="./images/eccleston.jpg" alt="The Ninth Doctor, Christopher Eccleston."/>
                    <p>A northern accent. Big smile, and an offbeat sense of humour… <strong>The Ninth Doctor</strong> was the bruised but brilliant ‘last of the Time Lords’.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="ten doctor">
                <img class="doc" src="./images/tennant.jpg" alt="The Tenth Doctor, David Tennant."/>
                    <p><strong>The Tenth Doctor</strong> was a charismatic mixture of apparent opposites… Kind and sensitive, only countered by his ruthlessness at times. </p>
            </div>

                <img class="doc" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p00s7x9l.jpg" alt="The Eleventh Doctor, Matt Smith."/>
                    <p><strong>The Eleventh Doctor</strong> was an excited explorer of the universe, with a keen intelligence that means he often notices what everyone else has missed.</p>

                <img class="doc" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/images/ic/480xn/p04znlgh.jpg" alt="The Twelfth Doctor, Peter Capaldi."/>
                    <p>Initially stern and ruthless, but in reality kind and forgiving, <strong>the Twelfth Doctor</strong> was the first incarnation after the end of The Siege of Trenzalore.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="thirteen doctor">

                    <p><strong>The Thirteenth Doctor</strong> was a charismatic and confident explorer, championing fairness and kindness wherever she can.</p>

                    <p>After The Master's attempt to steal The Doctor's body, the need to regenerate came... and <strong>The Edge Doctor</strong> was born.</p>
